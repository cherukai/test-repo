Hello! This project titled "assignment7" is a coding assignment that I had to do for school where I designed a pair of basic games to help with improving one's arithmetic skills.
To start, a menu prompting the player to select an option will appear first.
  - there the player may choose between playing a specific type of game, printing their score from said game, or quitting
  - game 1: arithmetic game (can choose between testing addition or multiplication)
  - game 2: guessing game (allows you guess numbers within a max range that the player sets)
  - print score: prints the score of games that were played during a session
  - quit: exits the menu and ends the program
